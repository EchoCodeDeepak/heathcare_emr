# Lab Technician CRUD View Implementation

## Tasks
- [ ] Update LabResultController with full CRUD methods (index, create, store, show, edit, update, destroy)
- [ ] Create LabResult model if needed (or use PatientMedicalRecord)
- [ ] Add missing routes for lab-results CRUD in web.php
- [ ] Create views: lab-results/index.blade.php, create.blade.php, edit.blade.php, show.blade.php
- [ ] Ensure authentication and permissions (view-lab-results, add-lab-results, edit-lab-results, delete-lab-results)
- [ ] Use same Bootstrap theme as other views
- [ ] Test the functionality

## Notes
- Lab results are integrated with patient medical records
- Lab technician can view/add/edit lab results in medical records context
- Use existing permissions or add new ones if needed
